## Outline
*This project is compatible with mobile, tablet and desktop*

This calculator works by pushing each button's assigned value to an array. The user's input is first checked as valid. If valid, the equation is calculated and displayed on the screen.

Note: This calculator was first made using the eval() method. Having learned of the security flaws in using eval(), I rebuilt the calculator using number methods and without the use of eval().

## Technologies

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* ReactJS
* NodeJS
* Google API

Kodfit began as a team project for the Kodiri coding internship. At the conclusion of the internship the members of the group went on to other projects. The following three weeks I continued working solely on the project, as I enjoyed working on the app and it had a number of areas for improvement, mostly with cleaning up the code and improving the layout for desktop users. At the end of the three weeks, this is the final result.
